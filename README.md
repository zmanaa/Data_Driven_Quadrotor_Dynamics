# SINDY-DMD Quadrotor
This a repository for "__DATA DRIVEN DISCOVERY OF QUADROTOR EQUATIONS OF MOTION USING SPARSE IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND DYNAMIC MODE DECOMPOSITION ALGORITHMS__" Project for AE540 course.

We apply the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to discover the quadrotor governing equation from numerical simulation data.
