# SINDY-DMD Quadrotor
This a repository for "__DATA DRIVEN DISCOVERY OF QUADROTOR EQUATIONS OF MOTION USING SPARSE IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND DYNAMIC MODE DECOMPOSITION ALGORITHMS__" Project for AE540 course.

We apply the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to discover the quadrotor governing equation from numerical simulation data.

## Current Status:
- A Planar Quad Rotor is 
- ```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```

## Installation
### For Planar Quadrotor Simulation:
1. run the _main.m_ file.
### For SINDy Trainer:
1. Dependinces
2.  ``import numpy as np
import seaborn as sb
import pandas as pd
import pysindy as ps
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``
